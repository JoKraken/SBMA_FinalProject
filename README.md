# SBMA_FinalProject



### What we want to do

We want to program a sport App. You can do the following things:



* track the data of a run

* track your gps position

* see an overview of the last runs

* turn on and off the sensors


### For whom is Runnis useful?

Runnis is meant for athletes who want to track where they go and how fast they go. They can use their data to learn where they need to improve!


### Where can I find more help?

On the home page everything is explained provided you have no existing runs completed. If you need more information you can make an issue in the github repository.
